	+ DART system v0.3
    + Video game and music album rental shop software v0.3
    + by Altansukh T.

**Running**
---
	+ Java JDK 14.0.x and up
	+ Written on IDEA IntelliJ 2020.3
	+ Download, extract, compile and perhaps pray that it still compiles ...
	+ Resource file's absolute path detection could be issue if it complains about NullPointerException in mainMenu when importing user and product data.
	+ Default manager password is "admin1234" and other users are mostly "password123".
	+ Login as manager, and press options 9 & 10 to load the data. After that, free for all.

**Configuration Options**
---
	+ CSV source file must exist in src/dit042/resources folder.
	+ Backup copies are provided as a reference

**How to use**
---
	+ How is the OOP structure?
		- Generally a sound start-up architecture for absolute beginner Java learner
	+ Which pattern is this?
		- Thought I was doing MVC, but ended up with something in between. Nevertheless, it was indeed a step in the right direction.
	+ Should I copy and do similar code like this?
		- Challenge yourself. You can do better than me.
